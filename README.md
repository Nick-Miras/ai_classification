# AI WASTE CLASSIFICATION
This was a project made in conjuction with student researchers from the Maasin City National High School. It involves taking pictures of waste with an ESP-32 Camera, sending those images to a Flask API running on an Ubuntu 22.04 LTS server, using a finetuned RESNET-152 Convolutional Neural Network for classification, and segragating it according to it's type (i.e. Biodegradable, and Non-Biodegradable).
